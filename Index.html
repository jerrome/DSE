			<p class = "description">
				Snails can sleep up to 3 years during the hibernation period. The word "<b>Hibernation</b>" means that an animal sleeps during long periods of time in extreme weather conditions. Land snails, however, hibernate when the weather is too cold, whereas desert snails hibernate when the weather is too hot. Desert snail species hibernate by burrowing themselves into the sand  in order to retain moisture.

			<p class = "description">
			In the wild, lions like to hunt down big animals like blue wildebeest, plains zebra, African buffalo, Gemsbok, and giraffe.  In a day, adult lions would gorge themselves eating up to 100 pounds of food in one session.  Male lions can eat 95 pounds of food and females over 55 pounds of food per day. In captivity, lions eat less than those in the wild. Male lions consume 8 pounds of meat while female lions consume 6 pounds per day.

			<p class = "description">
				Horses sleep while standing because they could easily escape an attack by a predator. Sometimes, they lie down to sleep during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, or when they are comfortable. On some occasions, horses would have a buddy system where one horse would keep watch while the other horses go to sleep. The role of watch horse would rotate, allowing the horses in the herd to sleep, including laying down for necessary REM sleep.
